An Android smartphone application called the MedLink ambulance tracking system was created specifically for emergencies.
It tracks ambulances that transport patients to hospitals during medical emergencies and arranges for prompt medical assistance as needed.
To guarantee that emergency records are kept on-site, this system enables ambulance administrators to examine complete patient records from the database, 
including personal data like names, blood types, residences, and other contact details. The app's hospital feature, 
which enables instant identification and listing of nearby hospitals, is one of its attractions. To ensure that the hospital has the doctors, treatment, 
and equipment ready in advance, the administrator changes the patient's profile and notifies the hospital of the occurrence in the event of a medical emergency.
The key highlight of this application is providing doorstep doctor consultations and pharmacy services for elderly and physically challenged individuals.
The application, which consists of four modules Ambulance Admin, Users, Doctors, and Hospitalsâ€”is built with Flutter, Google Maps API, and Firebase.
